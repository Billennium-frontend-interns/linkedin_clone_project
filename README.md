# Reflection

We create this application for an internship at Billennium.

We want this application to resemble the original as much as possible and such functionalities as the ability to log in / create an account, add posts, the ability to follow other users and view their profiles

The purpose of creating this application is to see what working in a team on a real project looks like and to improve our programming skills

Application development issues: nothing by now

Status : beginning
